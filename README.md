## Technical details

### Architecture

This app has been developed using a simple MVVM architectural pattern. MVVM (Model View ViewModel) is an architectural pattern which attempts to more clearly separate the development of user-interfaces (UI) from that of the business logic and behaviour in an application. The app has three major layers: 
- The **Presentation** layer, which contains the views and other UIKit-related units.
- The **Domain** layer, which contains the business logic and use cases.
- The **Data** layer, which contains the networking, the models and authentication logic needed to connect to the Marvel API.

### Tests

This app has a bunch of unit tests. The networking model, as well as the models and authentication logic has been tested thoroughly. The code coverage is not 100% as it contains the unit test cases only.
